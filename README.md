# 👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Benyamin Ebrahimpour 

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I hold a PhD in applied mathematics with a multidisciplinary background in battery modelling, neural networks, renewable energy systems, and mathematical 
modelling of electrochemical processes. I have extensive experience in Li-ion battery modelling, including reduced-order physics-based models, Bayesian inference, and the development of neural network 
surrogate models, and my expertise spans data analysis, and machine learning applications for energy systems.

🔬 Currently working on:  
- 📊 Mathematical Modelling of Li-ion Batteries (neural network surrogate models, reduced-order methods for physics-based models, and equivalent circuit models)
- 🤖 Machine Learning and Data Analytics
- 🌍 Renewable Energy Harvesting, Conversion, and Storage
