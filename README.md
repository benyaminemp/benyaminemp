# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Benyamin Ebrahimpour

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a PhD student in Data Science with a background in mathematical modeling, deep learning, and lithium-ion battery systems. My research focuses on developing data-driven and physics-informed models for battery state estimation, sensor calibration, and predictive analytics.

ğŸ”¬ Currently working on:  
- Modeling and simulation of lithium-ion batteries  
- Physics-informed deep learning  
- Scaled tank tests under flight conditions

## ğŸ”§ Featured Projects

### [Li-ion-Batteries ğŸ”‹](https://github.com/benyaminemp/Li-ion-Batteries)
A collection of battery models and learning algorithms developed during my PhD:
- **Single Particle Model (SPM)**: A lightweight electrochemical model
- **Corrected SPM (cSPMB)**: My own extension of the SPM for blended electrodes
- **MLP for Battery Prediction**: Simple NN for tasks like capacity forecasting

> More models will be added soon after related publications are out!
