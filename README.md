# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Benyamin Ebrahimpour

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a PhD student in applied mathematics with a multidisciplinary background in battery modelling, neural networks, renewable energy systems, and mathematical 
modelling of electrochemical processes. I have extensive experience in Li-ion battery modelling, including reduced-order physics-based models, Bayesian inference, and the development of neural network 
surrogate models, and my expertise spans data analysis, and machine learning applications for energy systems.

ğŸ”¬ Currently working on:  
- Modelling and simulation of lithium-ion batteries  
- Statistical learning and neural networks
- Data analytics

## ğŸ”§ Featured Projects

### [Li-ion-Batteries ğŸ”‹](https://github.com/benyaminemp/Li-ion-Batteries)
A collection of battery models and learning algorithms developed during my PhD:
- **Single Particle Model (SPM)**: A lightweight electrochemical model
- **Corrected SPM (cSPM)**: An extension of the SPM
- **MLP for Battery Prediction**: Simple neural network for tasks like voltage forecasting

> More models will be added soon after related publications are out!
