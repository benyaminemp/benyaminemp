# 👋 Hi, I'm Benyamin Ebrahimpour

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I hold a PhD in applied mathematics with a multidisciplinary background in battery modelling, neural networks, renewable energy systems, and mathematical 
modelling of electrochemical processes. I have extensive experience in Li-ion battery modelling, including reduced-order physics-based models, Bayesian inference, and the development of neural network 
surrogate models, and my expertise spans data analysis, and machine learning applications for energy systems.

🔬 Currently working on:  
- Mathematical Modelling of Li-ion Batteries (neural network surrogate models, reduced-order methods for physics-based models, and equivalent circuit models)
- Machine Learning and Data Analytics
- Renewable Energy Harvesting, Conversion, and Storage

## 🔧 Featured Projects

### [Li-ion-Batteries 🔋](https://github.com/benyaminemp/Li-ion-Batteries)
A collection of battery models developed during my PhD:
- **Single Particle Model (SPM)**: A lightweight electrochemical model
- **Corrected SPM (cSPM)**: An extension of the SPM
- **MLP for Battery Prediction**: Simple neural network for tasks like voltage forecasting

> More models will be added soon after related publications are out!

### [Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)](https://github.com/benyaminemp/Particle-Swarm-Optimisation)
An educational Jupyter Notebook showcasing the **PSO algorithm** in action:
- 📈 **Customisable Cost Function**: Easily adapt it to your optimization problem
- 🧠 **Swarm Intelligence**: Position and velocity updates using inertia, cognitive and social components
- 📊 **Convergence Visualisation**: Track the best solution over iterations
- 📝 **Markdown Guidance**: Step-by-step explanations make it beginner-friendly

> Great for building on top of the PSO framework.
